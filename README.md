Introduction
This workbook documents my hands-on practice with SQL using the World Database.
The focus was on joining tables, filtering data, and performing basic analysis with SQL.

Problem-Solving Approach
Step 1: Understand the task requirements.
Step 2: Explore the database schema.
Step 3: Write and test SQL queries.
Step 4: Analyze and interpret the results.
Step 5: Troubleshoot and optimize queries as needed.
Key SQL Queries
Example 1: Querying Cities by Continent
SQL
SELECT city.name, continent
FROM city
RIGHT JOIN country ON city.countrycode = country.code
WHERE continent = 'Europe';
Replace with your explanation or output here.

Example 2: Countries and Their Capital Cities
SQL
SELECT country.name AS Country, city.name AS City, city.population AS Population
FROM city
LEFT JOIN country ON city.id = country.capital
WHERE capital IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY population;
Replace with your explanation or output here.

Example 3: Calculating Population Density
SQL
SELECT 
    SurfaceArea, 
    ROUND(Population / SurfaceArea, 2) AS PopulationDensity 
FROM  
    country 
WHERE  
    Population IS NOT NULL AND Population > 0 
ORDER BY  
    PopulationDensity ASC 
LIMIT 20;
Replace with your explanation or output here.

Example 4: Cities with Above-Average GDP Per Capita
SQL
SELECT   
    city.Name AS City,  
    city.CountryCode,  
    country.Name AS Country,  
    city.Population AS CityPopulation,  
    ROUND(country.GNP / country.Population, 2) AS GDPPerCapita  
FROM   
    city  
JOIN   
    country ON city.CountryCode = country.Code  
WHERE   
    country.Population > 0 AND country.GNP IS NOT NULL  
    AND (country.GNP / country.Population) > (  
        SELECT AVG(GNP / Population)  
        FROM country  
        WHERE Population > 0 AND GNP IS NOT NULL  
    )  
ORDER BY   
    GDPPerCapita DESC; 
Replace with your explanation or output here.

Screenshots & Results
